<p><strong>Let's talk testing.</strong></p>

<img src="sa.jpg" alt="description here" width="450" height="270" />
<center>
<br></br>
<p> It's a well-known fact that most tests are incredibly important, and that in highschool, you test <i>ALOT.</i> 
 So, if you're wondering about TeenFAQ's most recommended testing straegies for any test. <i>Continue reading!</i><p>
 
 <p> So, let's get this straight. You're probably a highschool teenager that's geniunely worried about how to do better on some pretty major tests.
 <b>That's your first mistake</b> Stop worrying! Most people figure that if they don't pass a test or two, 
 that their life will magically fall apart completely. <b>It won't</b>
 You need to stop stressing yourself out about a few questions. Seriously, chill out.</p> 
 <p>Second, I know that this step is pretty basic but it's essential: <b>study</b>. We all hate it, but we have to do it. 
 You shouldn't let anything get in the way of you studying, not friends, not games, and definetly not sleep. You can sleep when you've graduated. 
 Get atleast an hour of studying a day when you're trying to prepare for a test, however, never go above four hours of studying because then you're not really learning anymore.
 Pace yourself, and you'll do perfectly. </p>
 <p> Hey! We have one more major step for you! <b>Set realistic goals for yourself.</b> I'm not saying that you should be a quitter, just be practical, 
 and all-in-all completely and totally okay with your choice. For example, if you're scoring a 1000(new)/1500(old) on the SAT, don't aim to get a 2600 in a month. It's not realistic. 
 Not because your incapable of it, but because you don't have enough time and because it's really hard to get that score.<i> Aim high, but not too high. Know when to finish, but never ever quit.</i>
 <b>Remember, don't base your happiness on a score; you are worth so much more than that.</b></center>
